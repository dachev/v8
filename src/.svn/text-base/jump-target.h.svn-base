// Jump targets
//
// A jump target is an abstraction of a basic-block entry in generated
// code.  It collects all the virtual frames reaching the block by
// forward jumps and pairs them with labels for the merge code along
// all forward-reaching paths.  When bound, an expected frame for the
// block is determined and code is generated to merge to the expected
// frame.  For backward jumps, the merge code is generated at the edge
// leaving the predecessor block.
//
// A jump target must have been reached via control flow (either by
// jumping, branching, or falling through) at the time it is bound.
// In particular, this means that at least one of the control-flow
// graph edges reaching the target must be a forward edge.
